This is a prototype content-based image retrieval system implemented with Keras and scikit-learn in Python.

The system uses the KNN algorithm with cosine similarity in order to find images similar to the input query.

The feature vector of all images are extracted from the internal layers of a convolutional deep neural network.

This prototype is based on Fashion MNIST dataset.
