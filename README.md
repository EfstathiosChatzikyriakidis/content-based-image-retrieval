This is content-based image retrieval system implemented with Keras and scikit-learn in Python.

The system uses the KNN algorithm with cosine similarity in order to find similar images.

The feature vectors of the images are extracted from the internal layers of a convolutional deep neural network.

This prototype is based on Fashion MNIST dataset images.
